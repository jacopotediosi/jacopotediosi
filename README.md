### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jacopo Tediosi, an Italian full-time penetration tester with a passion for cybersecurity.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in bug bounty programs as both a triager and hunter.

My projects primarily involve Python3 and Java, with Docker being a key component of my workflow. I'm also a big fan of NGINX.

Recently, I've been exploring the inner workings of Android, including reverse engineering several applications and creating mods that make use of root privileges.
