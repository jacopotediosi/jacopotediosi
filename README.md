### Hi 👋

I'm Jacopo Tediosi, an Italian full-time penetration tester with a passion for tech and cybersecurity.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects and hunting for vulnerabilities in real-world systems.

I'm comfortable working with Python3, Java, Docker, and Nginx.

I previously spent time reverse engineering Android applications and developing mods using root privileges and LSPosed modules.

Currently, I'm most active in the 3D printing community, doing my best to contribute to the [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint) and its plugin ecosystem.
